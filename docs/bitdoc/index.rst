Overview
########

* `Project X-Ray <https://github.com/f4pga/prjxray>`__ aims to provide information to develop a free and open Verilog to bitstream toolchain for the Xilinx 7-Series FPGA architecture.

* `Project Trellis <https://github.com/f4pga/prjtrellis>`__ enables a fully open-source flow for ECP5 FPGAs using Yosys for Verilog synthesis and nextpnr for place and route, providing the device database and tools for bitstream creation.

* `Project IceStorm <https://github.com/f4pga/icestorm>`__ was the first bitstream documentation project that started the idea of a fully Open-Source flow for FPGA chips. It documents the whole iCE40 chip.
